## Market Relevance

Specialist stores play a crucial role in the South African skincare market by providing expert guidance, premium products, and elevated shopping experiences that cannot be replicated by mass retailers or online channels. While representing a smaller portion of total market volume, these retailers command significant value share through premium pricing and capture the most engaged, high-value skincare consumers. Specialist stores serve as brand builders, trend setters, and education centers, influencing skincare culture and consumer behavior across the broader market.
